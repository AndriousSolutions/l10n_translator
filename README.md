The idea behind this library package is to allow your app to easily display its text in any number of supported translations. Those translations are stored in a easily readable Map varibles accessed by developers and non-developers alike.
#### Sample App
Use the example app that accompanies this library package can be implemented and used in your Flutter app: [example](https://github.com/AndriousSolutions/example/)
#### Installing
I don't always like the version number suggested in the '[Installing](https://pub.dev/packages/L10n_translator#-installing-tab-)' page.
Instead, always go up to the '**Major**' value in the semantic version number when installing my library packages. This means always entering a version number with then two trailing zeros, '**.0.0**'. This allows you to take in any '**minor**' versions introducing new features, or in this case, any '**patch**' versions that involves bugfixes. Semantic version numbers are always in this format: **major.minor.patch**.

1. **patch** - I've made bugfixes
2. **minor** - I've introduced new features
3. **major** - I've essentially made a new app. It's broken backwards-compatibility and has a completely new user experience. You won't get this version until you increment the **major** number in the pubspec.yaml file.

And so, in this case, add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file instead:
```javascript
dependencies:
  l10n_translator:^1.0.0
```
